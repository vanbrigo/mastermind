            <ul>-The objective of the game is to guess the exact positions of the colors in the computer's sequence.</ul>
            <ul>-A color can be used many times in a code sequence.</ul>
            <ul>-After filling a row with your guesses and clicking on the 'Check' button, the computer responses with the result of
                your guess.</ul>
            <ul>-For each color in your guess that is in the correct color and correct position in the code sequence, the computer
                display a small red color on the right side of the current guess.</ul>
            <ul>-For each color in your guess that is in the correct color but is NOT in the correct position in the code sequence,
                the computer display a small white color on the right side of the current guess.</ul>
            <ul>-You win the game when you manage to guess all the colors in the code sequence and when they all in the right
                position.</ul>
            <ul>-You lose the game if you use all attempts without guessing the computer code sequence.</ul>
